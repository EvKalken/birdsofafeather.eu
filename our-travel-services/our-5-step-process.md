# Our 5-Step Process
## How We Create Your Custom Georgia Trip

When you choose us for your travel planning, we follow a meticulously refined 5-step process to design the perfect Georgia vacation tailored specifically for you and your companions.

Before diving into Step 1, we start by getting to know you. We ask questions like:

- How many people will be traveling? 
- What are the ages and interests of the travelers?
- How much time do you have, and do you have a budget?
- Describe your perfect day in Georgia.
- Have you been to Georgia before? If so, what did you see? If not, have you traveled abroad before?
- Are there any must-visit places or experiences you want to include? Whether it's as specific as "visit the sulfur baths in Tbilisi" or as general as "enjoy wine tasting in Kakheti".

### Step 1: Crafting The Itinerary

The first step is to create the overall itinerary based on your feedback. We’ll suggest destinations and activities that we believe you’ll love. If you’re torn between different regions or experiences, we can help make those decisions easier.

During this stage, you’ll let us know:

- What you definitely want to do.
- What you’d like to do if it fits.
- What you’re willing to save for another trip.

From there, we’ll develop an itinerary that:

- Includes all of your “must-dos”.
- Maintains a realistic and enjoyable pace.
- Works geographically to avoid unnecessary travel back and forth.
- Provides a balanced mix of experiences (e.g., city -> countryside -> small town -> coast).
- Is logistically sound, whether you prefer to drive, take trains, or use private transfers.

### Step 2: Finding The Perfect Accommodations

With the overall itinerary set, we move on to booking accommodations. Whether you prefer boutique hotels, cozy B&Bs, luxurious resorts, or unique Airbnbs, we’ll find options that meet your preferences and budget.

We’ll consider your needs, such as:

- Hotel size and type (boutique, large, family-run).
- Desired amenities (on-site restaurant, gym, pool).
- Room specifics (views, balconies, suites).
- Family or group requirements (e.g., separate beds for kids, spacious bathrooms).

We’ll present you with the best options that:

- Match your preferences.
- Stay within your budget.
- Are centrally located.
- Have availability for your travel dates.

You’ll have the final say, and we’ll handle all bookings, ensuring every detail is perfect.

### Step 3: Guides, Tours, And Activities

Next, we dive into planning your activities. From the must-see sites identified in Step 1, we’ll work out the specifics:

- Would you prefer a private guide for exploring Tbilisi, or join a small group tour?
- Do you want a VIP experience at historical sites or a relaxed visit with skip-the-line tickets?
- For a cooking class, do you envision a professional chef-led session or a homely experience with a local cook?

We’ll recommend and book activities that suit your interests, whether it’s hiking in Kazbegi, wine tasting in Kakheti, or a relaxing day at a thermal spa.

### Step 4: Handling Logistics

Logistics can make or break a trip. We’ll ensure everything runs smoothly, from transportation to timing:

- Train tickets, rental cars, or private drivers—whatever suits your itinerary best.
- Airport transfers, boat schedules, and local transport details.
- Walking routes and considerations for light or heavy travel days.

We’ll handle all these details so you can focus on enjoying your trip.

### Step 5: Food And Restaurants

Food is a highlight of any trip, and we’ll make sure you savor the best of Georgian cuisine. We’ll book:

- Fine dining experiences.
- Authentic local eateries.
- Special occasion restaurants.
- Casual spots for a quick bite.

Whether you have dietary restrictions or specific preferences, we’ll find the perfect places for you. We recommend having dinner reservations, especially during high season, to avoid the hassle of finding a place when you're hungry.

## And Finally…

Before you depart, we’ll provide a comprehensive pre-trip checklist with advice on travel insurance, packing tips, technology needs, and more. Your detailed itinerary will include all hotel, activity, and restaurant information, ensuring you have everything you need at your fingertips.
