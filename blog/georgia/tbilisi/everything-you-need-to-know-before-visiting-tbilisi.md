## Currency and Payments

The currency in Georgia is the Georgian Lari (GEL). Credit cards are widely accepted in hotels, restaurants, and shops, but it's a good idea to carry some cash, especially when visiting local markets or smaller establishments.

## Language

The official language is Georgian, which has its own unique alphabet. While English is not widely spoken among older generations, many young people and those working in the tourism industry speak English. Learning a few basic Georgian phrases can be helpful and appreciated by locals.

## Safety

Tbilisi is generally a safe city, with a low crime rate. However, as with any travel destination, it’s wise to stay vigilant, especially in crowded areas and tourist spots. Keep an eye on your belongings and avoid walking alone late at night.

## Cultural Etiquette

- **Dress Modestly:** While Tbilisi is quite modern and cosmopolitan, it’s respectful to dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites. Women should consider carrying a scarf to cover their heads when entering churches.
- **Hospitality:** Georgians are known for their hospitality. If you’re invited to someone’s home, it’s polite to bring a small gift, such as sweets or flowers.
- **Table Etiquette:** When dining, wait for the host to make the first toast. It’s also customary to try a bit of everything offered to you, as refusing food can be seen as impolite.

- **Khachapuri:** A cheese-filled bread that's a staple of Georgian cuisine.
- **Khinkali:** Georgian dumplings typically filled with meat, herbs, and spices.
- **Pkhali:** A variety of vegetable pâtés made from spinach, beets, or beans.
- **Churchkhela:** A traditional Georgian sweet made from grape must, nuts, and flour.
- **Georgian Wine:** Georgia is one of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world. Be sure to try local varieties like Saperavi (red) and Rkatsiteli (white).
