## Attractions

Start your budget-friendly tour of Tbilisi in the Old Town, a maze of narrow cobblestone streets, colorful houses, and historic churches. Exploring this area is completely free, and it's a great way to soak in the city's atmosphere. Don't miss the Narikala Fortress, where you can enjoy stunning panoramic views of Tbilisi. The hike up to the fortress is free, or you can take the cable car from Rike Park for a small fee.

## Affordable Food

Tbilisi is a paradise for food lovers, and you don't have to spend a lot to enjoy its culinary delights. Local bakeries are a great place to start, offering fresh and delicious khachapuri (cheese bread) and lobiani (bean-filled bread) at very reasonable prices. Street food stalls are another budget-friendly option, where you can try dishes like khinkali (dumplings) and mtsvadi (grilled meat skewers).

For a sit-down meal, seek out small, family-owned restaurants that serve traditional Georgian cuisine. These establishments often offer hearty meals at affordable prices, allowing you to sample a variety of local dishes without spending too much.
