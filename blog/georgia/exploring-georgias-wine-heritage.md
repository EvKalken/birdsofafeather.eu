## The Birthplace of Wine: A Historical Journey

Georgia's winemaking history is one of the oldest in the world, dating back to the Neolithic period. Archaeological discoveries have uncovered qvevri (large clay vessels used for fermentation and storage) that date back to 6000 BCE, making Georgia the birthplace of winemaking. The ancient method of fermenting grapes in qvevri, buried underground, is still practiced today and has been recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage.

Wine has always been more than just a beverage in Georgia; it’s a symbol of hospitality, tradition, and identity. From ancient times, wine has played a central role in Georgian rituals, feasts (supra), and daily life. The traditional Georgian feast, led by a toastmaster (tamada), is an experience that showcases the deep respect and love Georgians have for their wine.
