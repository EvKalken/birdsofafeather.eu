## The Heart of Georgian Cuisine: Supra

At the core of Georgian culinary tradition is the "supra," a traditional feast that showcases the country's deep-seated hospitality and love for communal dining. The supra is more than just a meal; it is a celebration of life, family, and friendship, presided over by a "tamada" (toastmaster) who leads the guests through a series of toasts, each with its own significance and story.

## Bread and Cheese: The Staples

Bread and cheese are staples of the Georgian diet, each with its unique variations and cultural importance.

- **Puri (Bread):** Georgian bread is often baked in a "tone," a traditional clay oven. The most iconic variety is "shotis puri," an elongated bread with a crispy crust and soft interior. The process of baking puri is an art form, with bakers skillfully shaping the dough and sticking it to the inner walls of the oven.
- **Sulguni (Cheese):** A semi-soft, brined cheese, sulguni is a staple in Georgian households. Known for its elasticity and slightly tangy flavor, sulguni is often used in various dishes, including the famous "khachapuri."
